*** SETUP/USAGE ***

Setup:
1. Ensure that J2EE session variables be enabled! You will not be able to authenticate if this is disabled.
2. The cfesapi folder should sit at the webroot level.
3. Copy /cfesapi/esapi/esapi-2.0.1.jar and selected files from /cfesapi/esapi/libs/ to your lib folder (see compatibility below).
4. Restart ColdFusion.
NOTE: there are folders included with CFESAPI that you will want to exclude from your production environment

Tests:
- You will need to create an 'esapi' folder under your User Home directory so the users.txt file can be written to disk i.e. C:\Users\myusername\esapi\
- You can run the MXUnit tests using: /cfesapi/test/TestSuite.cfm

Demos:
- See the /cfesapi/demo/ for basic examples of implementation.

Implementation:
- You can extend any of the default implementations to overwrite the methods you need
 and/or
- You can create new implementations that implement the provided interfaces

How:
- Copy the /cfesapi/esapi/configuration/esapi/ folder to a location within your CF application and make changes to your copy of the config files
- ESAPI.properties
	- IMPORTANT: Run /cfesapi/org/owasp/esapi/reference/crypto/JavaEncryptor.cfm to calculate your *own* Encryptor.MasterKey and Encryptor.MasterSalt values
	- Update the component paths with the location of your implementation components
	- Modify other configs as needed
- Include the /cfesapi/helpers/ESAPI.cfm in your application
- Call the filters provided by CFESAPI to secure and authenticate each request.
- See demos for examples

Tips:
- You can determine whether unlimited strength crypto is installed by running: /cfesapi/test/org/owasp/esapi/reference/crypto/CryptoPolicy.cfm

Todo:
- Windows Executor tests are finally working! - Unix Executor has not been tested - NEED TESTER!
- modification of JSESSIONID cookie not working for HttpOnly, Secure, and reset (killCookie) - fix this! - this causes problems when the J2EE session expires; if killCookie worked would resolve this - right now, you have manually delete the JSESSIONID cookie from browser to get around this
- AccessReferenceMap interface, implementing components, and tests
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) - none of this currently exists
- determine better way to implement Filters
- What to do about version conflicts with JAR's?  Solution: add version object under ESAPI storing required versions and actuals??? Log issues?
- Railo 3.3 compatibility

Known Issues:
- When you receive Unauthorized msg in FBA Demo app, the Logout link does nothing - CAUSE: authorization check is before the logout check
